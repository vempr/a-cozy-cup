# a cozy cup:

A simple Godot experience that takes part in a cocoa shop on top of a mountain.
Weird people come to your store, though they are all nice to you.
No penalties, no pressure, just making warm drinks & vibes. Get
to know the strange & diverse individuals that the world has to offer.

Built in one day (13 hours) for Siege, a [Hack Club](https://hackclub.com) coding challenge.

*Yes, Visi is meant to be inVISIble :)*
